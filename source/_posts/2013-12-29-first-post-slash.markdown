Hi everyone! I've decided to start my own blog that will have just about anything! (food, code, math, etc) I figure it's time to do something useful and productive over winter break instead of bumming on Facebook all the time. Hopefully I'll learn something new! I'm using [Octopress](octopress.org) for my blog and it's been a relatively straightforward process :D.
