I'm writing this post on the train because I have nothing else better to do and I can't fall asleep :(.

Winter break this year was pretty uneventful and unproductive, which in a way was good for me I think. I literally didn't do anything. Except get my drivers license (yay!). Those wide right turns though (my only mistake lol). I also started playing this MMORPG called Tera, and it was pretty fun until it got boring, cause you basically do the same thing over and over again (killing monsters, getting items etc). I kinda wish I did something a little more meaningful though. I guess I'll tell myself that this blog counts.

I also watched Frozen with a couple of my high school friends, and I have to say, it was one of the best movies I have seen. The soundtrack was especially powerful and captivating, and even now, I'm still listening to Let It Go on the train. Apparently they're going to convert the film into a broadway show, which would be awesome (haven't watched a broadway show before #shameful).

Also, so much for New Year's Resolutions. I guess I never really made any, but I did want to learn how to cook more of my dad's dishes and lose some weight. The past couple of days, I've been eating way too much and gained back all my weight (omg green tea mochi ice cream is so good). I did learn how to make a couple of dishes though, which hopefully prove to be useful.

Here's my first attempt at fried rice!

Here's an attempt at shrimp fried rice along with some fish maw soup that includes cilantro!

I also learned how to make the tomato egg dish that Chinese people seem to love.

Too bad there isn't really a kitchen in Dunster, which kinda sucks.

Anyways, there are still around 10 days before class actually starts, and so I'm free to do stuff. I got into the ski trip, which should be exciting and pretty fun hehe. Some of my blockmates and linkmates are also doing the innertube waterpolo, which should also be fun :D.

I think I might take 5 classes next semester. I already have 4 classes in mind, which are:

*	CS124
*	CS262
*	Stat 111
*	VES40a

Probably going to shop around for more classes, like CS181, CS207, Ec1010b. Hopefully CS181 will be much better this year if I decide to take it, because last year, it seemed like everyone had complaints. 

Anyways, here's to a great semester!
